Task-1: 
      A number guessing game where the player is required to guess a number between 1 and 100. 
      If the player's guess is equal to the randomly generated number, the player wins. 
      If the guess is less than or greater than the number, the player is informed that the number is higher or lower than their guess, respectively.

Task-2:
      A simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. 
      The user is prompted to enter an algebraic expression, and the program processes it and returns the result.

Task-3:
      A Student Grading System that calculates the average, highest, and lowest grades of students. 
      The program uses a vector of custom structures to store the first name, last name, and grade of each student. 
      The user is prompted to enter the details of each student in a loop, which continues until the user chooses to stop.
      Once all the student details have been entered, the program calculates the average grade by summing up all the grades and dividing by the number of students. 
      The program also finds the highest and lowest grades by initializing variables to the first student's grade and then iterating through the vector to update them as necessary.
      Finally, the program prints the average grade, highest grade, and lowest grade, along with the names of the students who received them.

Task-4:
      A Word Count program that allows users to calculate and display the total number of words in a text file. 
      The program uses an interactive menu system for users to choose from available options, including calculating the word count of a file and exiting the program.

Task-5:
      A Movie Ticket Booking System with a menu-driven interface. 
      It utilizes classes to represent movies, seats, and bookings. 
      The system initializes a seat map and includes predefined movies. 
      Users can view available movies and their ticket prices, book seats for a selected movie, and display booked tickets. 
      The seat map is presented visually, distinguishing between booked and available seats. 
      The program offers a straightforward user experience with options to interact with the booking system until the user chooses to exit. 
      The code demonstrates fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, file handling, and user interaction in a console-based application.
